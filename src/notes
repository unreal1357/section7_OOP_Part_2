HAS A relationship

computer has a motherboard, case and a monitor

the motherboard, case and monitor are not computers in the same sense that a car is vehicle.
but a computer has a motherboard, a case and a monitor - this is composition - modelling parts of the greater whole (computer)

model it as HAS A relationship


general rule is to use composition before inheritence


encapsulation

restricts access to certain components in objects creating - stop classes outside of inner workings of another class

encapsulation allows to override so that we have more control, so we cant make mistakes in main.
